The CPGs do not address the connectivity challenges that arise during a time of international crisis or wartime. For example, MFA requiring codes via cellphones become a denial of service attack if the cell network is down. Similarly, cloud services will be disrupted in the event that the internet is lost, disabled or segmented. 
There need to be viable alternate/backup security constructs or an adversary will use our own security as a weapon to disrupt critical operations and infrastructure.
Both security and simplicity are basic doctrines of war. 
Not planning for disruptions or loss of some cpabilities will result in jury-rigged solutions offfering no security. 
Trans-attack and reconstitution planning are essential if CPGs are to be effective.
